**Caption:**
I spent today building my entire content creation pipeline with Claude Code. Here's what happened:

Instead of manually browsing YouTube, writing hooks, and crafting captions — I built a system that does ALL of it automatically.

The pipeline:
1️⃣ Discovers high-performing YouTube videos using AI-powered keyword search
2️⃣ Extracts transcripts and identifies the most valuable insights
3️⃣ Generates two types of Reels scripts — one for talking head, one for text overlay
4️⃣ Saves everything to Notion with relevance scores, timestamps, and CTA keywords
5️⃣ Runs inside Docker on a schedule — set it and forget it

The best part? Total monthly cost is $0. YouTube API, Gemini AI, and Notion all have free tiers that cover everything.

This is what being an AI-native solopreneur looks like. You don't work harder — you build systems that work for you.
