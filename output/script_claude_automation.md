**HOOK** (0-3s)
I built a full content automation pipeline with Claude in ONE session.

**WHY** (3-10s)
Creating 10 Reels scripts per week used to take me HOURS. Finding videos, extracting insights, writing hooks, captions... all manual. As a solopreneur, that time kills you.

**HOW** (10-40s)
Here's exactly what I automated with Claude Code:

1. **YouTube Discovery** — AI searches YouTube with my target keywords, filters by views, engagement, and recency. Only the best content surfaces.

2. **Transcript Extraction** — Automatically pulls subtitles from every video. No manual watching needed.

3. **Script Generation** — Gemini AI transforms transcripts into ready-to-film Reels scripts. Two formats: talking head AND text overlay style.

4. **Notion + CSV Storage** — Every script auto-saves to my Notion database with scores, timestamps, and CTA keywords.

5. **Docker Deployment** — The whole thing runs in a Docker container. Set it, forget it. Cron job handles the schedule.

**RESULT** (40-48s)
From zero to 10 Reels scripts per week. Fully automated. Zero extra cost — YouTube API, Gemini, and Notion are all free tier. My only cost? My Claude subscription I was already paying for.

**Caption:**
I just built my entire content pipeline in a single Claude Code session. Here's what it does:

From YouTube discovery to ready-to-film Instagram Reels scripts — completely automated.

The system:
1. Searches YouTube with strategic keywords targeting my niche
2. Filters videos by engagement, views, and relevance
3. Extracts transcripts automatically
4. Generates two types of Reels scripts:
   - Talking head (tutorial, tips, celebrity lessons)
   - Text overlay + music (numbered tips, numbered lessons)
5. Saves everything to Notion DB with scores and metadata
6. Runs on a schedule inside Docker

Total cost? $0/month on top of my existing subscriptions.

10 scripts/week. Zero manual work. That's the AI solopreneur advantage.
